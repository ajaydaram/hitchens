### Pornography

#### Effect of pornography

- **Impact on relationship:** damaged trust; attachment injury; secrecy around its use (hide, lie)
- **Impact on self:** shame, guilt, sense of emptiness
- **Impact on spouse's self-image:** relational trauma

#### Progression of pornography addiction

1. Increasing site navigation and hiding internet use
2. Increasing self-stimulation and reduction of sexual desire with spouse
3. Trying to meet other women through the internet
4. Going to prostitutes

#### Traits that characterize addiction

- **Inability to abstain and increased irritation when thwarted**
- **Impaired behavioral control:** loss of behavioral control: indulging in porn for hours, jumping from site to site
- **Desire or increased craving for rewarding experiences:** persistent pursuit of the behavior - compulsiveness towards the behavior
- **Preoccupation:** high level dissociative sexual fantasy – less present, analgesic effect; time spent thinking, planning, visualizing, rearranging the schedule, and hiding the behavior
- **Decreased recognition of impact on significant people and continued use despite adverse consequences**
- **Progression due to tolerance and shift to riskier behavior for the same level of reward**
- **Withdrawal symptoms:** mood swings due to despair and shame; depression, insomnia
- **Craving** – Impossible to control – Continuing despite the consequences – Aggravating use
- **Dopamine may play a role in addictive behavior and impulse control.**

#### Assessing the pornography user:

- When the behavior started
- The past and current use of pornography
- The extent of sexual addiction in other areas
- Presence of STD and AIDS for self and spouse
- Level of motivation for stopping addiction
- Attempts at solutions to change and relapses
- What are the current stressors?
- What is social support for change?

#### First order change:

- **Basic behaviors:** List actions that the user simply cannot do if he wants to avoid a relapse.
- **Risky behaviors:** List actions or activities that the user wants to avoid because of the risk of relapse
- **Recovery zone behaviors:** Set and work towards goals to continue living in the recovery zone
- **Relapse prevention:** Make daily checks to ensure he is in the recovery zone in these areas (publicly and privately): spirituality, work, family, other relationships, feelings, money, alcohol, other drugs

#### Second order change:

- **Transformation in the inner person through the work of the Spirit**

#### Areas of disclosure for openness and building trust:

- When the user started, what he engaged in, with whom (for the benefit of the partner), where, the type of pornography (to be aware of his arousal pattern)

#### Distinguishing signs of recovery

- Priority of time and effort over healing and recovery
- Meeting sex addiction recovery groups and attending regular counseling sessions
- Taking personal responsibility and is accountable to people for his time, thoughts, and actions.

#### Helping the addict's partner

- Assess depression, anxiety, symptoms and relationship dynamics. Don't blame the addict's partner as a co-addict. There is enough pain, disappointment, destabilization and even shame felt.
- Provide crisis and trauma management and support to regain safety. Test for STDs and AIDS
- Encourage setting up of boundaries, self-care, empowerment to do what they can do
- Encourage the partner to build a safe support group or group for sex addicted partners: validate emotions and support each other and learn tools to manage and not feel alone.
- Educate the substance-using spouse about the impact on the partner
- Encourage the partner to ask for help. Triggers like movies, television, shopping malls, touching, beautiful girls, and events, often trigger strong feelings of pain, anxiety, anger.
- Boundaries:  - computer out of the room, physical distancing for a while
- Create a personal care plan: emotional/mental; spiritual, physical aspect.

In the English language and grammar, sentences are categorized into four distinct classes or moods, each serving a specific purpose in communication. Let's delve into these classes to understand their characteristics and usage.

1. **Declarative Sentences:** These sentences make a statement or assertion of fact. They expect the reader to comprehend and contemplate the information presented. For example, "Many shall come in my name." Declarative sentences end with a period.

2. **Exclamatory Sentences:** Exclamatory sentences express strong emotion or emphasis. They often include interjections and are meant to evoke an emotional response from the reader. For example, "Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Take heed that no man deceive you." Exclamatory sentences end with an exclamation mark.

3. **Imperative Sentences:** Imperative sentences give commands or instructions. They expect the subject of the sentence to respond with corresponding action. The subject may not be explicitly stated, but it is understood. For example, "Get thee hence, Satan." Imperative sentences end with a period or an exclamation mark for emphasized commands.

4. **Interrogative Sentences:** Interrogative sentences are questions that expect a response from the person addressed or the general audience. They can ask for various types of information, such as who, what, when, where, why, and how. For example, "When shall these things be?" Interrogative sentences end with a question mark.

Understanding these four classes of sentences helps in constructing clear and effective communication. Whether you are making a statement, expressing strong emotion, giving commands, or asking questions, choosing the right class of sentence enhances your ability to convey your message accurately.

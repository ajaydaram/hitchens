### Cognitive Distortions that Create Problems

1. **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** Tendency to evaluate things, personal qualities, events in extreme black or white categories. E.g. If your performance falls short of perfection, you see yourself as a total failure.

2. **Over-generalization:** Tendency to see a single negative event as a never-ending pattern of defeat. E.g. If a young man was rejected in his job interview, he concluded that because he was turned down once, he would be turned down again and again.

3. **Selective Abstraction/Mental Filter:** Tendency to pick out a single negative detail and dwell on it exclusively so that the whole situation is seen as negative, like wearing a pair of sunglasses that filters out all the positives.  E.g. A person focuses on what is missing in her dinner party and concludes that she is a bad hostess.

4. **Disqualifying the Positive:** Transforming neutral or positive experiences into negative ones. Discounting positive experiences so that a negative belief can be maintained even though it is contradicted by everyday experiences. E.g. When someone compliments you, you mentally disqualify it be telling yourself, “Oh, they are just being nice.”

5. **Jumping to Conclusions:** Making a negative interpretation even though there are no definite facts that convincingly support the conclusion.
   - **Mind reading:** To arbitrarily conclude that someone is reacting negatively to you and that he/she is intentionally wanting to hurt you and you don’t bother to check it out.
   - **The Fortune-Teller Error:** Anticipating things will turn out badly and being convinced that the prediction is an already established fact.

6. **Magnification (Catastrophizing)Minimization:** Tendency to exaggerate the importance of things (such as your goof-up or someone else’s achievement), or you inappropriately shrink things until they appear tiny (your own desirable qualities or other’s imperfections).

7. **Emotional Reasoning:** Taking emotions as evidence for the truth, as reflecting the way things are. E.g. ‘I feel inadequate, therefore, I must be a worthless person’. ‘I’m not in the mood to do anything, therefore I might just as well lie in bed. I feel overwhelmed and hopeless, therefore my problems must be impossible to solve.’

8. **‘Should’ statements:** Motivating self by saying ‘I should do this…’ or I must, ought…” When behavior falls short of standards, the ‘shoulds’ and ‘shouldn’ts’ can create self-loathing, shame, and guilt as well as condemnation of others. When ‘should’ statements are directed at others, one feels anger, frustration, and resentment. Except 10 commandments set by God.

9. **Labeling and mislabeling:** An extreme form of generalization. Instead of describing the behavior, one attaches a negative label to oneself. E.g. ‘I am a born loser’ or ‘I am good for nothing’. Mislabeling involves describing an event with words that are inaccurate and emotionally heavily loaded. ‘How utterly stupid and dumb I am not to notice that I have been shortchanged.’

10. **Personalization:** Assuming responsibility for a negative event even when there is no basis for doing so or when you are not primarily responsible for. E.g. When a mother saw her child’s report card, there was a note from the teacher indicating that the child was not working well. She immediately decided, “I must be a bad mother. This shows how I’ve failed.”

#### Steps to take for change:  

1. Be aware of automatic negative/distortive thoughts.
2. Listen to how you talk to self and others.
3. Write down these thoughts on paper.
4. Learn what kind of cognitive distortions they are.
5. Substitute with a more objective thought.

#### Another method:

1. Learn to regard thoughts as hypotheses rather than facts.
2. Test the hypotheses.
3. Piece together the assumptions that underlay and generated these hypotheses.
4. Challenge assumptions and rules that are incorrect.

#### Examples of assumptions:

- If I am not on top, I am a flop.
- If I make a mistake, it means that I am inept.
- My value as a person depends on what others think of me.
- I can’t live without love. If my spouse (sweetheart, parent, child) doesn’t love me, I am worthless.
- I should know, understand, and foresee everything.
- I should be able to find a quick solution to every problem.

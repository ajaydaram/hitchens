The word "law" here might not be understood in the common manner or according to human ways, as if you were to say that the law here, in this place, is nothing but learning, which teaches what ought to be done and what ought not to be done, as it is with human law where the law is fulfilled with outward works only, even if the heart is far from it. But God judges based on the heart's intentions, thoughts, and secret movements of the mind. Therefore, His law requires the sincerity of the heart, love from its deepest part, and is not satisfied with outward actions alone. It rebukes those works most which do not come from love, even if they appear outwardly honest and good. Just as Christ in the gospel rebuked the Pharisees above all others who were open sinners, calling them hypocrites, which means pretenders and painted graves. These Pharisees, however, lived outwardly in such a way that no one could find fault with their deeds and actions according to the law. Yet, Paul confesses about himself that, regarding the law, he was such a person that no one could complain about him; and yet he was a murderer of Christians, persecuting and tormenting them so much that he forced them to blaspheme Christ, and was completely merciless, like many who now pretend to do good works outwardly.

For this reason, Psalm 115 calls all people liars because no one keeps the law from the depth of their heart, nor can they keep it, even though they may outwardly perform good works. For all people are naturally inclined toward evil and hate the law. We find in ourselves an aversion and reluctance to do good, but a desire and pleasure in doing evil. Where there is no free desire to do good, the heart does not fulfill the law, and undoubtedly there is sin, and wrath is deserved before God, even if there is a great outward show and appearance of honest living.

For this reason, St. Paul concludes in the second chapter that all Jews are sinners and transgressors of the law, even though they make people believe, through the hypocrisy of outward works, that they fulfill the law. He says that only the one who does the law is righteous before God, meaning that no one fulfills the law with outward works alone. "You," he says to the Jew, "teach that one should not commit adultery, and yet you commit adultery yourself...In which you judge another, you condemn yourself; for you yourself do the very same things which you judge" (Romans 2:1, 22). As if to say, you live outwardly in accordance with the works of the law, and judge those who do not. You teach others, and see a speck in another person's eye, but are not aware of the beam in your own eye. For even though you keep the law outwardly in your works, out of fear of rebuke, shame, and punishment, or for the sake of reward, advantage, and vain glory, you do all this without desire and love for the law, and would much rather do otherwise if you did not fear the law. Yes, inwardly, in your heart, you would wish that there were no law, no, not even God, the author and avenger of the law, if it were possibleâ€”so painful it is for you to have your desires restrained and to be kept under control.

Therefore, it is a clear conclusion that you, from the depth and bottom of your heart, are an enemy of the law. What good is it then that you teach another not to steal, when you yourself are a thief in your heart, and outwardly would like to steal if you dared? Although the outward deeds may not always manifest with such hypocrites and pretenders, but break forth, just as an evil sore cannot always be kept in with the force of medicine. "You teach another, but do not teach yourself; yes, you do not know what you teach, for you do not understand the law correctly" (Romans 2:21), that it cannot be fulfilled and satisfied except with sincere love and affection; much less can it be fulfilled with outward deeds and works alone. Moreover, the law increases sin, as he says (chapter 5), because man is an enemy of the law, since it requires so many things that are completely contrary to his nature, of which he is not able to fulfill even one point or tittle as the law requires. Therefore, we are more provoked and have a greater desire to break it.

For this reason, he says that "the law is spiritual" (Romans 7:14); as if to say, if the law were physical and only human doctrine, it might be fulfilled, satisfied, and quieted with outward deeds. But now the law is spiritual, and no one fulfills it except by doing everything from a loving heart and inward affection. Such a new heart and strong inclination towards the law you can never attain by your own strength and effort, but by the operation and working of the Spirit. For the Spirit of God alone makes a person spiritual and like the law, so that now he does nothing out of fear, or for gain, or advantage, or vain glory, but out of a free heart and inward desire. The law is spiritual, and will be loved and fulfilled only by a spiritual heart; therefore, it necessarily requires the Spirit, who makes a person's heart free, and gives him desire and courage towards the law. Where such a spirit is not, there remains sin, resentment, and hatred against the law; which law nevertheless is good, righteous, and holy.

Therefore, acquaint yourself with the apostle's way of speaking, and let this be firmly fixed in your heart, that it is not the same thing to do the deeds and works of the law, and to fulfill the law. The work of the law is whatever a person does or can do of their own free will, of their own strength and effort. However, as long as there remains in the heart an aversion, reluctance, resentment, grief, pain, loathsomeness, and compulsion towards the law, then all works are useless, lost, and even damnable in the sight of God. This is what Paul means when he says, "By the deeds of the law no flesh will be justified in the sight of God" (Romans 3:20). From this, you can see that those sophists are deceivers who teach that a person may and must prepare themselves for grace and the favor of God with good works before they have the Spirit and true faith in Christ. How can they prepare themselves for the favor of God and for what is good, when they themselves can do no good, nor can they even think a good thought or agree to do good, since the devil possesses their hearts, minds, and thoughts, holding them captive at his pleasure? Can those works please God, do you think, which are done with grief, pain, and reluctance, with an evil will, with a contrary and resentful mind? O holy Prosperus, how strongly did you refute this heresy with the writings of Paul twelve hundred years ago!

To fulfill the law is to do its works and whatever the law commands with love, desire, and inward affection and pleasure, and to live godly and well, freely, willingly, and without

 the compulsion of the law, as if there were no law at all. Such desire and free liberty to love the law come only through the working of the Spirit in the heart. For the Spirit is given only through faith, in that we believe the promises of God without wavering, knowing that God is true and will fulfill all His good promises towards us for the sake of Christ's blood. As Paul says, "I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes" (Romans 1:16); for as we believe the gospel preached to us, the Holy Spirit enters our hearts and frees them from the bonds of the devil, which previously possessed our hearts and held them captive, so that we could have no desire for God's will in the law. And just as the Spirit comes through faith alone, so faith comes through hearing the word, or gospel, of God, when Christ is preached, that He is God's Son and also man, dead and risen again for our sakes, as He says in chapters 3, 4, and 10. All our justification comes from faith, and faith and the Spirit come from God, not from us. When we say that faith brings the Spirit, it is not to be understood that faith deserves the Spirit, or that the Spirit is not present in us before faith: for the Spirit is always in us, and faith is the gift and working of the Spirit. But through preaching, the Spirit begins to work in us. And just as through preaching the law He works the fear of God in us, so through preaching the gospel He works faith in us. And now, when we believe and are under God's covenant, then we are assured of the Spirit by God's promise, and the Spirit accompanies faith inseparably, and we begin to feel His working. And so faith assures us of the Spirit and also brings the Spirit with it, to work all other gifts of grace and to work out the rest of our salvation, until we have completely overcome sin, death, hell, and Satan, and have come to the everlasting life of glory. And for this reason, we say that faith brings the Spirit.

From this it follows that faith alone justifies, makes righteous, and fulfills the law, for it brings the Spirit through Christ's merits. The Spirit brings desire, frees the heart, makes it free, and gives it strength to do the deeds of the law with love, as the law requires. Then, ultimately, from the same faith working in the heart, all good works spring forth naturally. This is what he means in the third chapter: after he has set aside the works of the law, so that it sounds as though he would break and annul the law through faith, he answers that which might be laid against him, saying, "We do not destroy the law through faith, but rather we establish, uphold, or confirm the law through faith" (Romans 3:31); that is to say, we fulfill the law through faith.

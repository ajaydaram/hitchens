Sin, according to Scripture, is not just the outward actions committed by the body, but includes the entire process and all that leads to the outward deed. It includes unbelief, inclination, and readiness to do the deed from the heart's depth, along with all the powers, affections, and appetites that can only sin. We say that a person sins when they are completely carried away into sin, as much as they are, by that poisonous inclination and corrupt nature in which they were conceived and born. No outward sin is committed unless a person is completely carried away, with their life, soul, heart, body, desire, and mind. Scripture focuses especially on the heart and the root and original source of all sin, which is unbelief in the depths of the heart. Just as faith alone justifies and brings the Spirit and desire for outward good works, unbelief alone condemns and keeps out the Spirit, provokes the flesh, and stirs up lust for evil outward works, as happened to Adam and Eve in Paradise (Genesis 3).

For this reason, Christ calls sin unbelief, notably in John 16. He says, "The Spirit will convict the world concerning sin, because they do not believe in me" (John 16:8-9). He also says, "I am the light of the world" (John 8:12). Therefore, he tells them, "While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may become sons of light...for whoever walks in darkness does not know where he is going" (John 12:35, 36). Just as Christ is the light, so the ignorance of Christ is the darkness He speaks of, in which those who walk in it do not know how to do a good work in the sight of God, or what a good work is. Therefore, Christ says, "As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world, but there comes a time when no one can work" (John 9:4, 5), which is the time of ignorance of Christ, in which no one can see to do any work to please God. Paul also exhorts that we "not walk as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their minds. They are darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them" (Ephesians 4:17-18). He also says in the same chapter, "Put off your old self, which belongs to your former manner of life and is corrupt through deceitful desires" (Ephesians 4:22), which is to say, ignorance. And, "Let us cast off the works of darkness" (Romans 13:12), that is, of ignorance and unbelief. And, "Do not be conformed to the passions of your former ignorance" (1 Peter 1:14). And "Whoever loves his brother abides in the light...but whoever hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes" (1 John 2:11). By light, he means the knowledge of Christ, and by darkness, the ignorance of Christ. For it is impossible for someone who truly knows Christ to hate his brother.

To understand this more clearly, you should know that it is not possible to sin at all unless a person breaks the first commandment beforehand. The first commandment is divided into two parts: "The Lord our God is one Lord; and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might" (Deuteronomy 6:4-5). The whole reason I sin against any lesser commandment is that this love is not in my heart. If this love were written in my heart, and if it were full and perfect in my soul, it would keep my heart from consenting to any sin. The whole and only reason this love is not written in our hearts is that we do not believe the first part, that "our Lord God is one Lord." If I understood what these words, "one Lord and one God," mean; that is, if I understood that He made all and rules all, and that whatever is done to me, whether good or bad, is still His will, and that He alone is the Lord who rules and does it; and if I understood what this word, "mine," means; that is, if my heart believed and felt the infinite benefits and kindness of God toward me, and understood and truly believed the many covenants of mercy by which God has bound Himself to be mine completely and entirely, with all His power, love, mercy, and might; then I would love Him with all my heart, soul, power, and might, and I would keep His commandments out of that love. So you see, as faith is the source of all goodness and good works, so unbelief is the source and root of all evil and evil works.

Finally, if anyone who has turned away from sin and has put their trust in Christ and kept God's law falls into sin at any time, it is because the flesh, through negligence, has overcome the spirit, oppressed it, and taken away its strength. The food of the spirit's strength is its meditation on God and His wonderful deeds, and on the many covenants of His mercy.

Therefore, before any good works, as good fruits, there must be faith in the heart from which they spring. And before any bad deeds, as bad fruits, there must be unbelief in the heart, as the root, source, essence, and strength of all sin. This unbelief and ignorance are called the head of the serpent, of the ancient dragon, which the woman's seed, Christ, must tread underfoot, as promised to Adam.

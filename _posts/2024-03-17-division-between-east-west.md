The Great Schism of 1054, a significant event in Christian history that marked the formal split between the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church and the split was occurred for various reasons: 

1. **Background**: The East-West division in Christianity, which culminated in the Great Schism of 1054, was the result of centuries of cultural, theological, and ecclesiastical differences between the Eastern (Greek-speaking) and Western (Latin-speaking) parts of the Roman Empire. These differences contributed to a growing sense of estrangement between the two regions, eventually leading to their formal separation. Some key factors that contributed to this division include:

1. **Language and Culture**: The Roman Empire was divided into two parts, with the East centered around Constantinople (Byzantium) and the West around Rome. The East spoke Greek and had a more Hellenized culture, while the West spoke Latin and had a more Romanized culture. This linguistic and cultural divide contributed to differences in liturgical practices, theological expressions, and ways of understanding the faith.

2. **Ecclesiastical Authority**: The Bishop of Rome (the Pope) and the Bishop of Constantinople (the Patriarch) both claimed authority over the entire Christian Church. This led to conflicts over jurisdiction and authority, with the Pope asserting his primacy based on the belief that he was the successor of Peter, the leader of the apostles. The Eastern Church, while acknowledging the Bishop of Rome as a primus inter pares (first among equals), did not accept his claims to universal jurisdiction.

3. **Theological Differences**: Over time, theological differences emerged between East and West, often related to differences in language, culture, and philosophical traditions. For example, Eastern theology was influenced by Greek philosophy, particularly the thought of Plato and Aristotle, leading to a more mystical and speculative approach to theology. Western theology, on the other hand, was influenced by Roman legal thought and tended to be more systematic and legalistic in its approach.

One of the key doctrinal issues that strained relations between the Eastern and Western churches was the inclusion of the **filioque clause** in the Nicene Creed. The Nicene Creed, formulated at the First Council of Nicaea in 325 AD and later expanded at the First Council of Constantinople in 381 AD, is a statement of faith that outlines the core beliefs of Christianity.

The original Nicene Creed affirmed the belief in the Holy Spirit proceeding "from the Father." However, in the West, particularly in the Frankish kingdom, the phrase "and the Son" (Latin: filioque) was added to emphasize the belief that the Holy Spirit proceeds from both the Father and the Son. This addition was motivated by theological concerns related to the equality of the Trinity and the role of the Son in the procession of the Holy Spirit.

The addition of the filioque clause in the Nicene Creed was not universally accepted in the Christian world. In the East, particularly in the Byzantine Empire and the Greek-speaking churches, the addition of the filioque clause was seen as a theological innovation and a departure from the traditional understanding of the Trinity. Eastern theologians argued that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father alone, as the source of the Trinity, and that the addition of the filioque clause introduced a form of "double procession" that was incompatible with Orthodox doctrine.

The dispute over the filioque clause became a major point of contention between the Eastern and Western churches and was a contributing factor to the Great Schism of 1054. The Eastern churches viewed the addition of the filioque clause as an unauthorized change to the Nicene Creed and as a symbol of Western theological overreach. The Western churches, on the other hand, viewed the filioque clause as a legitimate development of doctrine that emphasized the unity of the Trinity.

The dispute over the filioque clause continues to be a point of contention between the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches to this day. Efforts have been made to address this issue through theological dialogue, but significant differences remain, highlighting the deep theological and doctrinal differences that have divided the Eastern and Western churches for centuries.

4.  **Liturgical Practices**: The East and West developed distinct liturgical practices, with the East emphasizing a more elaborate and symbolic form of worship, centered around the Eucharist, icons, and the liturgical calendar. The West developed a more simplified and structured liturgy, with a greater emphasis on the role of the priest and the sacraments.

5. **Political and Cultural Factors**: The political and cultural differences between East and West also played a role in their estrangement. The Western Roman Empire collapsed in the 5th century, leading to the rise of independent kingdoms in Europe. In the East, the Byzantine Empire continued to exist, maintaining a strong centralized authority. These political differences contributed to a growing sense of separation between the two regions.

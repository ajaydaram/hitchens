## Historical Overview of Trinitarianism
- Heresies necessitated clarity on Trinitarian doctrine
- See all heresies erring on either the “One-ness” and/or the “Three-ness” of God
- Brief description of each heresy, then a summary

## Modalism/Sabellianism 
- Father and Son are the same person: no distinction of Persons
- Patripassionism (modalist monarchist) : i.e.“father-suffer”
- Sabellius (3rd Century): Father, Son and Spirit just different names/stages of one God

## Arianism/subordinationism (dynamic monarchist):
- Rever Christ as creature, but does not ascribe divine nature to him
- Paul of Samosata (3rd Century): adoptionism
- Arius (4th Century): One unbegotten God, contrast to Son as begotten, also Holy Spirit – these two are creatures
- Son has different ουσια (essence/substance) from Father
- Son is mediator, but not object of our worship (dynamic monarchist)

## Council of Nicaea (325AD): 
- 2 sets of heresies, but same basic error: Deny Threeness, acknowledge Oneness (Unity)
- Sabellianism rejected:
- Arianism rejected:
- Homo-ousia: same essence
- Nicaea set parameters for Trinitarian doctrine, but issues not resolved, e.g. how Spirit process from Father and Son

## Eastern & Western Fathers:
- Cappadocian (Eastern) Fathers: Emphasised distinctions of persons (analogy: three apostles)
- But lingering suspicion of Subordinationism?
- Augustine (Western): Emphasised Unity (analogy: soul/memory/intellect)
- But lingering suspicion of Sabellianism?
- Horton: Capp Fathers “hypostasis” (subsistence) a positive move in defining ontological status of the three Persons, distinct from their common essence (ousia)  
- Also developed doctrine of Holy Spirit: Trinitarian with distinct roles (e.g. in redemption)
- Subsequent Councils focused on divine & human natures of Christ – Doctrine of Christ
- The other extreme: Tritheism
- John Philoponus (6th Century): the Three without the One

## Before Nicaea (One and Three):
- One Only	One above Three	Three Only
- Modalism	Subordinationism	Tritheism
- e.g. Sabellianism (Sabellius)	e.g. Adoptionism (Paul of Samostat), Arianisn (Arius)	e.g. John Philoponus

## Filioque Clause (“Proceeds from”):
- Synod of Toledo (589 AD): unilateral action by Western Church
- Focus on the relationship of the three Person, less on their distinctions
- Eastern Fathers continued to emphasise the differences among the Three Persons: Father begotten Son
- Felt Filoque Clause did not appreciate this distinct attribute of the Father and distinct person of Holy Spirit
- Would eventually lead to East-West schism 

## Reformation era: 
- Rejection of Trinitarianism: Servetus and Socinians (extension of Arianism- rejected pre-existence of Christ)
- Calvin’s attempts to mediate differences between E and W:
- Argued for hypostasis to convey unity of Godheads and also
- integrity of each person, to guard against modalism
- Proposed  “Autotheos”: Each person has divine essence in himself – guard against subordinationism
- “Proceeding From”: not essence, but persons and attributes
- Each person has personal existence and share essential attributes, Father as Source
- The Father is the cause, origin, and source of all things, visible as well as invisible. The Son is the Word, the Wisdom, and the image of the Father.
- The Holy Spirit is the eternal power and might, proceeding from the Father and the Son. Nevertheless, this distinction does not divide God into three, since Scripture teaches us that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit
each has a distinct subsistence distinguished by characteristics yet in such a way that these three persons are only one God.
- Belgic Confession, Chap. 8 
- WCF 2.3
  1. Three Persons, One Substance
  2. Son is eternally begotten of Father
  3. Holy Spirit eternally proceeding from the Father and the Son

## Contemporary Issues: 
### Social Trinitarianism: Three over the One
- Moltmann: adopts Eastern Church’s distinction of Three Persons
- Extends it to focus on the communion of the Three: Perichoresis (mutual penetration and eternal fellowship)
- Shy away from their unity of essence
- Risk of Trithesim: cf Mormonism (polytheism at heart)

### Karl Barth’s three-fold repetition of One God: One over the Three
- Barth: Risk swinging over to modalism
- Cf. JW: denies Three Persons, depersonalises Holy Spirit
- Church history as tool to diagnose present trends

## Trinity is a Mystery
### Economic vs Immanent Trinity
- Theological attempts are analogical
-  God in himself eternally (cf. archetypal knowledge); we have no access (Ecomonic)
- Trinity as it is revealed to us (compare ectypal knowledge) (Immanent)

## God is One 
### One Invisible Essence
- needful against Tritheism and Subordination
- In OT, Deut. 6:4, God is One (against polytheism)
- Zech. 14:9, God will be King, His Name is One
- Even in NT, when three Persons are emphasised
- 1 Cor 8:6, One God
- Eph. 4:4-6, Trinity, but Oneness is asserted
- 1 Tim 2:5, One God, and One Mediator

## God is Three Persons 
### One Divine Being, but Three individual “Subsistences” (hypostases)
- Against Modalism
- Persons: distinct agents of actions, distinct self-consciousness
- All three are in action, and we can attribute different actions to each Person

## Three distinct persons
- Matt 28, Baptising in name of Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit
- 2 Cor 13:14, Benediction in the name of the Three Persons

## Three Persons act in relation to one another
- Ps 2:7, The LORD said to me, You are my Son, today I have begotten you
- Ps 110:1, The LORD said to my Lord…
- Matt. 11:25-27,Jesus prayed to Father
- Jn. 14:16-17, I will ask Father and He will give you another Helper
- Gal. 4:4-7, In fulness of time God sent His Son, and then Spirit into our hearts

## Their actions are also simultaneous
- Matt. 3:16-17, Baptism of Christ
- 1 Pet 1:2, sanctification by Holy Spirit and obedience to Son 

## Personality of Spirit asserted
- It has been questioned, but Scripture asserts it
- John 14:26 The helper will come…teach you; He will also bear witness
- Acts 5:3, Spirit can be sinned against
- Eph. 4:30, Grieve not the Holy Spirit

## Each Person is Fully God
### All Three Share in full essence of Divinity (contra subordinationism)
•	None is less God than the other
### Father’s Divinity: 
- “God” often refer to Father
- Jn. 1:1, 16:26-27, Word was God, from Father = from God
- Jn. 17:3, Father as the only True God, he stands for whole Trinity
- Rom. 1:7, 2 Cor 1:2, God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ
- Not just Paul; see also Jas. 1:1, 2 Pet. 1:3, God is common way of referring to the Father

### Son’s Divinity:  Divine titles, also Divine Attributes and Works 
- Not just whether “God” was used to refer to Him, but also whether divine attributes and works were assigned to him, e.g. did people worship Son? He can forgive sins (context of healing the paralyse man lifted down from the roof)!
#### Divine titles
- Tit. 2:13, Great God and Saviour
- Heb. 1:8-9, O God, your throne is eternal
- Other titles: Saviour in context of God as the Saviour, e.g. Tit. 1:4; also
-Alpha and Omega: Rev. 1:8, Holy One, etc.
- also Divine Attributes and Works
-John 5:26, Son has life in himself
- Acts 3:14-15, Author of life
- Col 1:16, All things created by him
- Heb. 1:3, Col 1:17, also sustained by him
- 2 Tim. 1:10, Rev. 5:9-10, Saviour, brings immortality, abolish death
- Ps. 130:3-4, God forgives sin, Mark 2:7, Lk 7:48-49, Christ forgives sin
- John 5:22, Christ as Judge
- Heb 1:16, worshipped by angels, and deserves worship by all: Phil 2:10

### Divinity of Holy Spirit:  Spirit’s titles and works also reveal his divinity
- Nicea and Chalcedon (451AD) focused on divinity of Son, e.g. Chalcedon asserted two natures of Christ; once done, divinity of third person less hurdle
- Basil the Great (Capp Father): Treatise on Holy Spirit
- Act 5:3-4, Lying to Spirit = Lying to God; person of Spirit joined to Father and Son = equal
- 1 Cor 12:4-6 divine gifts come from Spirit, Son and Father; work seen to be equal
- Also Eph. 4:4-6: Person assumed
- Spirit’s titles and works also reveal his divinity
- 2 Pet. 1:21, The one who inspires prophets
- 1 Pet. 1:2, saves and sanctifies
- John 3, regenerates
- Rom. 8, Gal. 4, Spirit of adoption
- Rom. 8:11, Resurrection: Spirit who raise Christ will also raise you
- Act 10:38: Anointed (empowered) Christ, enabling him to cast out demons (Matt. 12:28), offering himself to death by the Spirit (Heb. 9:14)

## Each Person has Unique Personal Attributes 
### Order in ontological and economic trinity
- Ontologically: Father uniquely negats Son, Son alone is begotten; Spirit alone proceeds
- Unique and incommunicable
- Economically: Father sends Son, Son submits to Father in economy of redemption
- Father and Son sends Spirit, Spirit glorifies the Son

### Work of God towards us 
- Every work of God is work of Trinity, but each has a distinct role
- Father initiates, mediated through the Son, consummated in the Spirit
- In Creation: God creates, world created through the Son, Spirit supervening over work
- In Redemption: Father saves, by sending His Son, who offers up atonement, and Spirit applies the benefits of Christ’s atonement to his people 
- Three persons share essential attributes, but have unique personal attributes: Father: generator/unbegotteness; Son: Filiations; Spirit: Procession
- Inter-trinitarian relationships described analogically, e.g. “begotten” not in the literal sense that we use 
#### Father and Son relationship:  
- Father uniquely begets Son, Son begotten of Father
- John 1:14-18, John in mind more than a created relationship, cf. Jn 1:1-3, transcends creation
- Ps. 2:7, see how NT uses this: Acts 13:33, Paul refers to resurrection, because Jesus was revealed as the Son through his resurrection; Son of Man vindicated
- Also cited in Heb. 1:5, Son alone is true God (contra angels), so Sonship seen as truly divine, yet also derived from the Father, cf Heb. 1:3, He is radiance of the glory of God
- Yet there is an order: Father before Son; first glory, then radiance of that glory
- So Church has used “begotten” to support “eternal generation”, which transcends creation 
- Col 1:15, image of the invisible God: image – Sonship; archetype, then image, but both transcends creation, see 1:16-17 (important when countering JWs who tend to use this verse to support subordination of the Son)
- John 17:24 same dynamics as above: Jesus has glory of Father: Church has rightly concluded that there is a divine Father-Son relationship in eternity (transcend creation)

#### Relationship between “Spirit” and “Father and Son” (i.e. Spirit vs Father & Son)
- Procession from the latter two
- John 15:26, Spirit proceeds from the Father, but note he sends the Spirit
- John 14:16, 26, Father sends Spirit in Son’s name: So it appears to be action of both Father and Son
- Upper-room discourse focuses on economic trinity, not ontological (which John 1 has explained to some extent)

#### Reflections: How to state the Inter-Trinitarian relationship?
- Generation attributed to Father
- Order: Spirit always the third, and usually named in association with Father and Son
- Spirit seems to reflect glory of both Father and Son
- Can say Spirit proceeds from Father, but Father is never known without the Son, he acts with the mediation of the Son
- Son is with Father from eternity, so cannot talk of father acting without Son, sending needs to be seen through the mediation of the Son
- So we can say Spirit proceeds from the Father and Son, or from the Father through the Son

## Implications
- Clear biblical basis for Trinitarian Doctrine: necessary inference if we assume coherence of Scripture. The whole counsel of God concerning all things necessary for his own glory, man's salvation, faith and life, is either expressly set down in Scripture, or by good and necessary consequence may be deduced from Scripture…
- WCF, 1.6
- Engaging Jehovah’s Witness and Mormons
- Prov. 8 – “Wisdom” as example of mistaken starting point
- Clarity of Trinitarianism: avoid two extremes: nulling the divinity of any of three persons, and Trintheism/polytheism
- Importance of distinction between ontological and economical terms, and the proper use of analogical language (“begotten”, “proceeds from”)
